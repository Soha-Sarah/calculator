# calculator
 This project demonstrates a simple **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** example in Python using a custom `Maths` class.    
 It performs basic arithmetic operations (**addition, subtraction, multiplication**) on two numbers and displays the results.  


---

## How it Works  

1. A **class** (`Maths`) is created with a constructor that takes two numbers.  
2. Inside the class:  
   - `Add()` adds the numbers  
   - `Sub()` subtracts them  
   - `Multiply()` multiplies them  
   - `Display()` prints everything  
3. An **object** is created and the methods are called to do the calculations.  

---  
## Output  
 ```python
Object = Maths(5, 3)   # create an object with numbers 5 and 3  
Object.Add()           # perform addition  
Object.Sub()           # perform subtraction  
Object.Multiply()      # perform multiplication  
Object.Display()       # show all results  
```

The output should be:  
``` python
first number = 5
second number = 3
result of addition = 8
result of subtraction= 2
result of multiplication = 15
```
